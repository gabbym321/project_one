<p>Picture living an regular life</p>
<li>
      You live alone with <span>no</span> kids, something you hope to change one day. 
      </li>
   <li>
    You go to work as a <span>Banker</span>, a job that you love! 
</li>
<li>
    You own a small fluffy <span>dog</span> who brings joy to you every day 
</li>
<br>
 <p> But how would you feel when you wake up one morning and <span>nothing</span> is as you remember? 
 </p>

 <p>You look like yourself, you sound like yourself but everything around you seems to have changed. 
 </p>

 <p>How should you react if you wake up next to a man they never seen before? If you go downstairs to find children you can't recognize calling you Mommy?
